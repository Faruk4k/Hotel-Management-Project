1) A customer can book 1 or many customer rooms and one customer room can be either free or booked by single customer during a given time frame. 
In our case there is not an alternative, since we would not want to limit customers to book only one room.

2)We have two types of admins(receptionist and managers) that both have different permissions. A receptionist can only manage rooms and bookings while the manager has access to employee information as well.
With that said, the second relation a room can be managed by one or more admins and admin can manage one or more rooms. There are no alternatives in our case here too.

3)admin with special permission (managers) can manage multiple or one employees and an employee can be managed by one or many admins.
In our case our admins have responsibility for all employees and all of them not for a certain department. In the case that we are left with just one admin 
at a certain period, then one to many relationship could turn into one to one relationship as we would only have one admin to mangage the employees.

4)One or many regular employees inspect/clean one or many rooms, and one or many rooms are cleaned/get inspected by one or many employees. 
Again here we dont have any other options since we dont want to assign just one employee for the room to clean.
